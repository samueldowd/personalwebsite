class="c28"><p class="c10 c17 c3"><span class="c0 c5 c2">The Rave Implementation Team at ECOG:</span><span class="c0 c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c5 c2">Tactically Solving Problems</span></p><p class="c10 c17 c3"><span class="c0 c25">Sam Dowd, Emily Engler, Deborah Grohe, Stein Tan</span></p><p class="c10 c3 c13 c27"><span class="c0 c5"></span></p><p class="c10 c17 c3"><span class="c0 c5">Background</span></p><p class="c10 c3 c14"><span class="c0 c2">The Rave Implementation Team at Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) was started in mid-2011 with the mission of coordinating the implementation of a new electronic data capturing system. Called Medidata Rave, this software would allow data from clinical trials across the country to be captured and stored digitally. This was a major change for the organization which was mainly pen and paper beforehand. The project would be complex and required the involvement of several different teams across the ECOG organization.</span></p><p class="c10 c3 c14"><span class="c0 c2">Called together to lead this implementation as part of a team were Judi, Rick, Mary, and Kerry</span><span class="c0">, f</span><span class="c0 c2">our high-ranking members of the ECOG staff, each with different responsibilities and interests in the Rave implementation. Judi, a 15-year veteran at ECOG, worked for the bio-statistician of the group, and provided a direct link to him from the implementation team. Rick, a 28-year veteran at ECOG, was the Manager of Information Systems. His group was responsible for the technical details of the implementation. Kerry, a 14-year veteran at ECOG, was the Data Management Manager, responsible for coordinating all of the data that was brought in by the clinical trials. Lastly, Mary, relatively new to ECOG with just three and a half years of service, was the Manager of Study Setup, a role that involved planning the early phases of clinical trials and studies. Each member brought their own group&rsquo;s interests to the team, and as a result the Rave implementation team had excellent representation from the pertinent areas, and had the power needed to make things happen.</span></p><p class="c10 c3 c14"><span class="c0 c2">In terms of mission, and their role at ECOG, the team was managing the NCI mandated implementation of this Medidata Rave system. ECOG is part of a network of cooperative</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;groups</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">funded</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;by the National Cancer Institute (NCI)</span><span class="c0">,</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">a</span><span class="c0 c2">ll of which had been mandated to move to Medidata Rave, and all were doing so simultaneously. While ECOG&rsquo;s implementation team did not have much interaction with the other cooperative</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;group</span><span class="c0 c2">s</span><span class="c0">&rsquo;</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;implementation teams, they were not necessarily working in a vacuum either. They heard stories about other teams, and learned some lessons from other successes or failures that those teams were having. However, to complicate this implementation, ECOG was in the process of merging with The American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN), who had their own implementation team. This merger would eventually cause the implementation teams to have to work together to ensure a smooth and successful implementation.</span></p><p class="c10 c3 c14"><span class="c0 c2">The team met weekly for two hours just before the weekly management team meeting. Having been working together since mid-2011, they had already hit several significant milestones, and had completed work on the brunt of the project. The project had several different elements to it, and each member of the implementation team having different stakes, their approach and view of each phase of the project was always different. For example, one part of the implementation could be technically dense, while less reliant on study setup. Therefore the majority of Rick&rsquo;s work would be done in that part, and Mary&rsquo;s piece of the project would still be yet to come.</span></p><p class="c10 c3 c14"><span class="c0 c2">This team, according to the team and task types that we learned about in class, was a problem solving team with some tactical elements built into it. Their roles were very clearly defined by their roles in the organization as a whole. They each represented their own department&rsquo;s interests in the implementation. Because most of the members had worked together for so long, there was a significant amount of &ldquo;trust in others&rsquo; intentions and efforts.&rdquo; They all realized that any one team member&rsquo;s suggestions or actions were for the greater good of the team and ultimately the implementation of this new software. Additionally there was a focus on the problem at hand, implementing Rave, and not so much of a focus on the team members as individuals. As far as the tactical elements go, they were certainly focused on the, &ldquo;execution on a clear plan.&rdquo; Their directives came from the ECOG leadership team, as well as directly from the NCI.</span></p><p class="c10 c3 c14"><span class="c0 c2">Outside of the implementation of the software itself, one issue that this team faced was its merger with the Rave implementation team from ACRIN. A team had been convened, essentially just a combination of the ACRIN and ECOG teams, called the ECOG ACRIN Rave Implementation (EARI) team. This team met several times in the beginning, but since then had not been meeting very frequently. Throughout our study of this team we watched carefully as they worked through the issues that came up throughout the implementation of Rave, and we observed their inevitable transition from the Rave Implementation Team at ECOG, to EARI.</span></p><p class="c10 c3 c13"><span class="c0 c2"></span></p><p class="c10 c17 c3"><span class="c0 c5">Investigation </span><span class="c0 c2 c5">Process</span></p><p class="c10 c3 c14"><span class="c0 c2">To study this team, we had them fill out one survey, we attended their weekly meetings over a three-week period, and we conducted one on one interviews with each member of their team. The survey allowed us to ask very broad question pertinent to team dynamics in general, including cross-referencing questions and opportunities for further comments using select comment boxes. With the surveys in hand, we attended their weekly staff meeting to observe their team dynamics, for further data collection, and to ensure the findings thus far correlated with what we had collected in the survey. This also allowed us to observe things such as body language, tone of voice, the arrangement of the room, and other interactions and qualities that are hard to detect using a survey. From there, we created targeted interview questions based on our previous findings and emerging analysis.</span></p><p class="c10 c3"><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The </span><span class="c0">Rave implementation</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;team has many clear strengths, which far outweigh their weaknesses. Theirs is a dedicated team, both to their projects at hand and to each other. The four people on this team genuinely like working together and respect each other&rsquo;s work. Their experience and varying perspectives serve to strengthen this team. They were clearly intelligent and able to communicate and work effectively with each other</span><span class="c0">, a</span><span class="c0 c2">nd their humor and genuine amiability toward one another </span><span class="c0">were</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;clear.</span></p><p class="c10 c3"><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of this team&rsquo;s weaknesses spring from the format of their meeting. There is no formal agenda from meeting to meeting. No one takes minutes for the team, and therefore, they are reliant as a team on their individual memory. Every team member works on a computer during their meeting, which seemed to sometimes lead to multi-tasking, with team members not being fully focused on the meeting item at hand. As with most other teams, they are also subject to factors outside their control, such as impending integration of the ACRIN team into their team. </span><span class="c0">These weaknesses, though, need to be seen within the context of this successful team. As such, the weaknesses do not have as much of a negative impact on this team as they would have on a different team. </span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The survey findings were relatively consistent and painted a clear and accurate picture of their team. All four members </span><span class="c0">rated</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;the highest for having confidence in their team&rsquo;s ability to complete tasks properly, and rated the highest as well on enjoying their interactions with their fellow team members. It was unanimous as well that the team handles conflict very effectively, that each person finds that the treatment of individual members is fair, and that they all had confidence in their team&rsquo;s ability to complete tasks properly. In answering the question regarding how much confidence each person has in their team&rsquo;s ability to complete tasks on time, it was mostly consistent as well, with half the team rating at a 4, and the other half rating it at 5 (with 5 being very confident).</span></p><p class="c10 c3"><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding honesty and team morale, there continued to be a unanimous picture. Every member rated that they perceived the team to be very honest with each other. The team policies, rules and norms were rated as being extremely fair across the board. All four rated the highest in their feelings about working with this team; and all four marked &ldquo;never&rdquo; for how often they find themselves in unproductive conflict with other team members.</span></p><p class="c10 c3"><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The questions about out-of-work relationships and autonomy rendered a wide range of responses, being the only areas of the survey in which there was either a differing in opinion, or perhaps a misunderstanding or miswording of the question. When asked how often they interact with other team members outside of work, two responded 1, &ldquo;never&rdquo;, one responded 4 and the last responded 5, with 5 being &ldquo;frequently&rdquo;. On the question regarding how willing they were to participate in team activities and projects outside of work, the four answers were all different, ranging the full scale from &ldquo;not willing at all&rdquo; to &ldquo;very willing&rdquo;. The two questions on autonomy also received four different answers, on whether team members have autonomy on deciding what projects to work on, and how much autonomy the team itself has when deciding on what projects to work on.</span></p><p class="c10 c3"><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial and broad observations of the team meetings </span><span class="c0">were in line with</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;the answers from the survey. Each meeting takes places in one of the members offices; Mary sits at her desk in front of her computer, while the other three members sit at the table next to it. There was an open door at every meeting; this may have been due to the early hour, as their meeting starts at 7 a.m. Three members are women ranging in age from 30&rsquo;s to 60&rsquo;s, and the fourth member is a man in his </span><span class="c0">5</span><span class="c0 c2">0&rsquo;s. Their personalities ranged from quiet to outgoing. There was an open flow of talking during their meetings. This is a warm and funny group of people who are very relaxed with each other. Based on what we heard meeting to meeting, they seemed to have a high level of trust, and were proactive as members and as a team.</span></p><p class="c10 c3"><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four interviews were conducted one-on-one; two of them were via phone and two were done in person. The interviews provided information on the team creation and structure, their team self-perceptions, as well as their progress on R</span><span class="c0">ave </span><span class="c0 c2">and the upcoming R</span><span class="c0">ave</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;challenges.</span></p><p class="c10 c3"><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This team was spontaneously created, as a sub-group of the ECOG Leadership Group, out of the necessity to</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;implement Rave</span><span class="c0 c2">. Theirs is a problem-solving team. All four team members identified Judi as the team leader, although she identified herself as a &ldquo;loud mouth&rdquo; rather than a leader. This self-perception was inaccurate in the context of the meetings; she was not louder or overbearing. As the leader, she allows for others to lead meeting to meeting, based on the topic at hand. Their meeting agenda is never formal, and rather is a free-flowing evolving agenda that is based on the most pressing issues. Each team member expressed in the interview that they were satisfied with this unorthodox format, which allows for their team to reactive to issues that arise between meetings.</span></p><p class="c10 c3"><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the interviews, team members reiterated the sense of camaraderie that was clear from the surveys; they genuinely like and respect each other. One person shared that these meetings are seen as useful and important to ECOG. Rick mentioned the &ldquo;home room&rdquo; or &ldquo;study hall&rdquo; aspect to these meetings. One interesting comment was that Mary and Kerry are very quiet in other meetings, but in this meeting and with this team they do not hold back.</span></p><p class="c10 c3"><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judi and Kerry both perceived that there is much work left to do with the R</span><span class="c0">ave</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;implementation. Rick and </span><span class="c0">Mary</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;vocalized a different perspective, that &ldquo;R</span><span class="c0">ave</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;is there&rdquo; and that the team is over the hump with R</span><span class="c0">ave</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;implementation. Kerry also recognized that incorporat</span><span class="c0">ing </span><span class="c0 c2">ACRIN into this team&rsquo;s function is an upcoming challenge to their team.</span></p><p class="c10 c3 c13"><span class="c0 c2"></span></p><p class="c10 c17 c3"><span class="c0 c5 c2">Analysis: Demystifying the ECOG Magic</span></p><p class="c10 c3 c14"><span class="c0 c2">This section goes over our analysis regarding </span><span class="c0">the Rave implementation team&rsquo;s</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;successful team dynamics. Here, we will argue that the way to demystify the </span><span class="c0">&ldquo;</span><span class="c0 c2">magic</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;that was present within the </span><span class="c0">Rave implementation</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;team was to consider various contributing factors that are supportive of team development and flourishing. Our argument will center on universal values like trust, respect, and openness and its relationship to the larger socio-cultural environment of the organization in which the team functions. Our argument will show how an interdependent team is a product of various interdependent factors.</span></p><p class="c10 c3"><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was something interesting about the </span><span class="c0">Rave implementation</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;group that quite challenged Lencioni&rsquo;s (2002) claim regarding the inherent nature of teams to be dysfunctional. Specifically, the magical harmony that the team showed was much enlightening and rewarding. As with most natural human inclination, it was difficult to not attribute the team&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0">&ldquo;</span><span class="c0 c2">magic</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;to luck. Though</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;doing</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;so, upon further reflection, one&rsquo;s natural explanation, a convenient explanation, does the team much injustice. In fact, the team&rsquo;s magical harmony could neither be explained in a vacuum nor be attributed to pure luck. More specifically, the outcome that we have experienced with </span><span class="c0">the Rave implementation team</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;was not only </span><span class="c0">the</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;result of the group meeting both necessary and sufficient conditions of what constitutes a team, </span><span class="c0">but also that </span><span class="c0 c2">the organization&rsquo;s cultural environment helped nurture and actualize the team&rsquo;s magic (Hackman 1990; Thomson 2000).</span></p><p class="c10 c3"><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The </span><span class="c0">Rave implementation</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;group embodied all the </span><span class="c0">&lsquo;</span><span class="c0 c2">Five Key Characteristics of a Team</span><span class="c0">&rsquo;</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;(Thomson 2000). Like a </span><span class="c1 c0">true</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;team, not a workgroup, the </span><span class="c0">Rave implementation</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;team showed much interdependence in its relations, information, tasks and deliverables (McGregor 1960). Crucial to the heart of this team was each member&rsquo;s trust on each other. Trust allowed everyone to rely on one another that he/she would support the group&rsquo;s interdependent work, </span><span class="c0">and</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;also support the common goal of the group. These conditions, together, create a more cohesive group identity for the </span><span class="c0">Rave implementation</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;team&mdash;i.e., a unity occurs.</span></p><p class="c10 c3"><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To some extent, the unity of the group provides insight to why neither gender bias nor age biases were present in the team. Instead, each member treated </span><span class="c0">each other</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;member as a person worthy of trust and respect, as he/she is a person that is both </span><span class="c0 c1">&lsquo;a means to an end and an end</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">in him/herself</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;&rsquo;(Kant 1993). This </span><span class="c0">essential </span><span class="c0 c2">foundation allowed team members to be open about their respective strengths and weaknesses with each other. Opening up one&rsquo;s vulnerability to one&rsquo;s team is a critical decision and action because it not only shows that trust is present, but acceptance and commitment from each individual will also ensue. Not surprisingly, when Judi talked about her weaknesses during the meeting or Rick </span><span class="c0">spoke of</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;some personal matters </span><span class="c0">with </span><span class="c0 c2">the group, both of them received support and acceptance, which in turn strengthens everyone&rsquo;s commitment and &lsquo;[bounded-ness] to the team and its members (Thomson 2000).</span></p><p class="c10 c3"><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the </span><span class="c0">Rave implementation</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;team, their trust, respect, and commitment </span><span class="c0">to</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;each other translate </span><span class="c0">into </span><span class="c0 c2">commitment </span><span class="c0">to</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;the work and success of the team (Lencioni 2002). This commitment allowed each member to rapidly provide help when needed, even when not asked. For instance, when Rick was trying to recall a specific study instance, Mary </span><span class="c0">was</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;there to rapidly check her computer and supply him with the information necessary. That aside, Judi and Kerri chimed in just as quickly. In short, everyone worked towards alignment not only in thoughts, but also words and actions&mdash;thereby increasing the virtuous cycle of trust (Galford &amp; Drapeau 2003). Such cooperative behavior highlights members&rsquo; understanding of the interdependencies of their respective tasks and that supporting is as important as delivering, as everyone gets affected when a person cannot deliver properly. Consequently, furthering on the thought regarding trust, respect, and acceptance, the nature of the team&rsquo;s work also contributes to everyone&rsquo;s commitment to both individual and team success.</span></p><p class="c10 c3"><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned earlier, the success of the </span><span class="c0">Rave implementation</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;team cannot be considered inside a vacuum. So far, we have seen that the nature of the team&rsquo;s work and their openness to trust, respect and acceptance of each other has been crucial in the team&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0">&ldquo;</span><span class="c0 c2">magic.</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;Though the list is impressive, other contributing factors remain worthy of mention. Specifically, teams are composed of social beings that operate in a social system. The social system</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;a team </span><span class="c0">is </span><span class="c0 c2">tie</span><span class="c0">d</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;closely </span><span class="c0">to</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;the organizational culture of </span><span class="c0">the</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;larger system. This, eventually, constitutes the working environment of the team. For ECOG, the culture of the organization definitely has positive influence on the subculture of the </span><span class="c0">Rave implementation</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;group that we studied. In fact, it is not surprising to see the interaction between the organization&rsquo;s higher-order culture and the </span><span class="c0">Rave implementation</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">team&rsquo;</span><span class="c0 c2">s lower-order culture to be reinforcing each other (Schein 2004). This socio-cultural interaction furthers the ties between members to the team and to the organization. Consequently, we obtain a high-performing and mindful group of people doing great work and having fun.</span></p><p class="c10 c3"><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the harmony being manifested by the </span><span class="c0">Rave implementation</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;group would be quicker to rationalize away through a convenient attribution to luck or magic. </span><span class="c0">S</span><span class="c0 c2">uch misattribution is indeed easier, if not somewhat romantic. Such cognitive biases that discredit the merits of others are not new and are destructive (Kunda 1999). Consequently, this section of the paper has decided to not only do justice to the </span><span class="c0">Rave implementation</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;team&rsquo;s success, but also embarked on the task to demystify the magic behind the chemistry that made a successful team. To sum, the team&rsquo;s success not only came from the internal strengths of each individual (Nicholson 2003), it also came with universal values like trust and respect being fostered not only in the team, but also in the organization.</span></p><p class="c10 c3 c13"><span class="c0 c2"></span></p><p class="c10 c17 c3"><span class="c0 c5 c2">Recommendations: Mak</span><span class="c0 c5">ing</span><span class="c0 c5 c2">&nbsp;ACRIN, EARI, </span><span class="c0 c5">&amp;</span><span class="c0 c5 c2">&nbsp;ECOG </span><span class="c0 c5">S</span><span class="c0 c5 c2">pell TEAM</span></p><p class="c10 c3 c14"><span class="c0 c2">If our team were to continue to work with the Rave Implementation Team, the focus would be on how to manage the prospect of integrating the ACRIN counterparts into the group. As was noted by Judi in her interview, the two groups cannot continue to function in parallel forever. We would need to thoroughly investigate before being able to make detailed recommendations.</span></p><p class="c10 c3 c14"><span class="c0 c2">There has been cooperation between the two groups in the Rave implementation process already with the EARI group, but that group has been meeting less regularly recently. &nbsp;We would need to determine whether the ECOG and ACRIN staff will be working together on Rave protocols in the future, which, as the groups combine, we believe would be the case. &nbsp;In addition to Rave implementation, the interfacing between the four departments that occurs in the Rave Implementation Team seems very helpful to the function of ECOG. It is not immediately clear whether there is a parallel structure at ACRIN. If there is, if the departments are aligned, it would probably be necessary to combine the groups in some way. ECOG and ACRIN staff would therefore most likely benefit from regular meetings that would cover the types of things that the Rave Implementation Team covers.</span></p><p class="c10 c3 c14"><span class="c0 c2">Even though ECOG and ACRIN are both cooperative groups in the same country, there will still be cultural differences between the ECOG and ACRIN people and the team will need to be aware of the differences. The type of structure that works for the Rave Implementation Team may or may not work for the larger group, but work should be done up front to establish a new culture in the new group, not assuming that the culture of the ECOG Rave Implementation Team would carry over.</span></p><p class="c10 c3 c14"><span class="c0 c2">Adding ACRIN members into the existing Rave Implementation Team would pose many challenges. The meeting structure is informal and works as well as it does because of the very close relationship between the team members. Adding ACRIN people to the team would change the dynamic of the team and we expect it would affect the effectiveness of the team. It would be best to have a new team form with members from the relevant departments of ACRIN and ECOG with a conscious effort made from the beginning to make it a high functioning team. The guidelines given in </span><span class="c0">C</span><span class="c0 c2">hapter 4 of Thompson&rsquo;s (20</span><span class="c0">10) </span><span class="c1 c0">Making the Team </span><span class="c0 c2">are a good place to start.</span></p><p class="c10 c3 c14"><span class="c0 c2">The first step is to define the task. The ECOG Rave Implementation Team has moved beyond Rave implementation, and it makes sense that a group that includes ACRIN people would also be doing the interdepartmental interfacing that is currently being done by the Rave Implementation Team, but with the addition of ACRIN data management, study setup, information systems and biostatics managers as well. In order for the team to be successful, they must know what the measurement of success would be by defining the team&rsquo;s task.</span></p><p class="c10 c3"><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Thompson (</span><span class="c0">2010)</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;also points out, establishing team norms up front will help ensure a high functioning team. A soccer game cannot be played if the size of the field, length of play and rules of the game have not been established. The same is true for teams. It is impossible to perform tasks if the rules of play have not been established. Within the team norms, it is key to emphasize the importance of trust and conflict management within the team. Conflict over personality or process is detrimental to team productivity, but task conflict is productive and can increase team creativity and expand ideas. Conflict can be dealt with productively only if the members trust each other.</span></p><p class="c10 c3 c14"><span class="c0 c2">It will also be necessary to identify team leadership both within the newly established team and outside of it. We must identify to whom this new team will report and whether there will be a formal or intrinsic leadership structure to the new team. In the article </span><span class="c0">&ldquo;</span><span class="c0 c2">Eight Ways to Build Collaborative Teams,</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;Gratton and Erikson (2007) illustrate the importance of buy-in from leadership to make a team successful. There must be buy-in from both ACRIN leadership and ECOG leadership, and when the time comes, from the combined ECOG-ACRIN leadership, in order to make this new team work. </span><span class="c0">In addition to the importance of buy-in</span><span class="c0 c25">, </span><span class="c0">Gratton and Erikson (2007)</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;also include a list </span><span class="c0">t</span><span class="c0 c2">hat primarily focus on the role of leadership in a team&rsquo;s success. One of the items, though, is about existing relationships on a team: &ldquo;Building on heritage relationships. When too many team members are strangers, people may be reluctant to share knowledge. The best practice is to put at least a few people who know one another on the team&rdquo; (</span><span class="c0">Gratton &amp; Erikson 2007, p. 104</span><span class="c0 c2">). The team members do know each other, and even though the relationships aren&rsquo;t as strong yet between the ECOG and ACRIN members, the strong bond that exists between the ECOG members would be an asset to the new team.</span></p><p class="c10 c3 c14"><span class="c0 c2">A final thing to consider is that it is possible that based on the needs of the newly combined organization the existing ECOG-only group will continue </span><span class="c0">to meet</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;in addition to the new ECOG-ACRIN team. If that happens, ground rules need to be established about communication between the groups. We would work with both the newly formed group and the existing group to identify the topics that would not be relevant to the joint group, and ensure that items that are relevant are brought to the larger group. Communication between the groups about relevant subjects will be essential to making the combined team function well.</span></p><p class="c10 c3 c13"><span class="c0 c5"></span></p><p class="c10 c17 c3"><span class="c0 c5 c2">Conclusion: ECOG</span><span class="c0 c5">. </span><span class="c0 c5 c2">ACRIN. Meet EARI, your New Best Friend</span></p><p class="c10 c3 c14"><span class="c0 c2">Judi, Rick, Mary, and Kerry have created a fantastic team despite being </span><span class="c0">somewhat</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;outside of the normal guidelines for good teambuilding. However, they have achieved levels of success that even some well-built teams never see. It will be essential that they maintain this momentum as ECOG merges with ACRIN. As a study group, we very much enjoyed our experience analyzing and coming up with recommendations for this team. We wish them the best of luck in the future, and hope that when the merger of ECOG and ACRIN finally happens and EARI is resurrected, the team stays effective and continues to provide their outstanding benefits to the new organization. </span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c17 c3 c22"><span class="c0 c5">References</span></p><p class="c22 c9 c3"><span class="c0 c2"></span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c0 c2">Galford, R. &amp; Drapeau, A.

class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c0">First noticed that the meeting/workplace was casual enough that the door was left open.</span></p><p class="c4 c3 c13"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c0">Of the four people in the room, Mary sat separate from the other three - this is due to her computer being docked at her desk (and there not really being room for another computer at the main table). Maybe coincidental, maybe not, she did not speak much during the meeting in regards to work matters unless she had something very concrete to add. This is not to say she didn&rsquo;t talk - she often had quick comments to make about side-issues (ie laughing about how another department is not cooperative) - she clearly isn&rsquo;t separate from the group that I could tell.</span></p><p class="c4 c3 c13"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c0">People were very much on their computers throughout the whole meeting. However, they clearly had camaraderie amongst themselves and there seemed to be clear respect and liking of each other.</span></p><p class="c4 c3 c13"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c0">The meeting had a slow, ambling pace. It wasn&rsquo;t clear to me who was leading it or who had set the agenda.</span></p><p class="c4 c3 c13"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c0">It was interesting to see the interactions and reactions amongst them when they talked about personal stuff:</span></p><p class="c4 c3 c13"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c0">When Mary made a comment about how it would be hard to have a certain conference call, Kerry made a kind of snide comment about being in the position of getting her two children out the door on Friday morning - the implication being that she had it harder, or kind of like &ldquo;welcome to the club&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c4 c3 c13"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c0">When Judi went on for a little while about a cyst that had been on her hand, Rick clearly wanted her to be done with it and didn&rsquo;t look to have patience to listen - he was looking down or off to the distance, his body was turned away from her, so his body language communicated not listening and not wanting to hear it (from how I read it). This was the only time in the meeting that Judi said much of a personal nature, so it was not as if she had being going on and on before.</span></p><p class="c4 c3 c13"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c0">Rick made one personal comment about his daughter asking him to pick her up at a specific time. His comment to her had been &ldquo;Do the math&rdquo; because she had asked him to pick her up earlier than he was able. I didn&rsquo;t notice others having any kind of a response to him besides paying attention.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c4 c3 c13"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c0">Stein Tan&rsquo;s Observations</span></p><p class="c4 c3 c13"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c0">People warm and welcome.

The house is built, and the windows are installed but it still needs to be painted and stuff. &#8532;-&frac34; of the way done. The integration into the overall operation still needs to be done.

A lot of the initial we need to get these studies implemented has come and gone, but there are still a lot of related issues.
