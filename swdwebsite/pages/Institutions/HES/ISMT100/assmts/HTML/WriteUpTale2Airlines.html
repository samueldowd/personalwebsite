I wish to tell you about what went wrong, and what British Airways can do to ensure that this does not happen to any other customers. I have identified three problems that are at the heart of the matter in this case, and suggested ways that you can improve and/or fix these problems.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c2">Problem #1: Professor McPherson was treated like a ticket number </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As the manager of a multi-national company in one of the fastest-paced of all service industries, it is important that you impress upon your employees that each customer has a name, a face, and a voice. Computers lump customers into demographics, ticket numbers, and collective statistics. Obviously, learning the names, connecting flights, destinations, or beverage preferences of all passengers would be very difficult for a flight or gate attendant. But the truth is, not every passenger cares. The ones that care about getting the personal attention are the ones paying $2,500 per seat like Professor McPherson. In this case your computers should put together a report for each flight of those highly valued customers. Collect information upon booking the flight like meal preference, beverage preference, and other special requests. This way flight and gate staff are able to provide first class service to those high-paying customers. At the very least your high-paying customers whose loyalty is crucial will become the gentleman in 4C who likes martinis and needs a blanket and pillow, as opposed to reservation XYZQRS.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c2">Problem 2: Collect pertinent data on your customers </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Computers can collect an enormous amount of data. Retail stores have proven this with loyalty cards. If your flight attendants were able to record patterns and special requests by your most loyal customers, their flight experience could be tailored each and every time to ensure satisfaction. It would be enormously valuable to your company to customize a flight experience to each high-paying customer each time they fly with you. Not only does this make them feel valued and desired as customers, they will get accustomed to an airline that knows their wants and needs automatically and continue to pay $2,500 for their flights to get that luxurious personalized service.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c2">Problem 3: Your customer did a lot of work on his own for $2,500</span></p><p class="c1"><a name="h.gjdgxs"></a><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s common knowledge in the customer service industry that the longer you give the customer to think about their situation, the quicker they will boil over with anger. That&rsquo;s why companies have strict guidelines on how long to keep customers on hold. Or, why you are interrupted while on hold with special offers, or gimmicks. The companies don&rsquo;t want you to think about how angry you are. Your customer, Prof. McPherson, paid $2,500 to be late to his first destination, rush to meet a connecting flight, miss the connecting flight, and be ignored by the gate staff. Your company should be collecting the data as previously mentioned, but also sharing it across your organization.</span></p><ul class="c4 lst-kix_list_1-0 start"><li class="c3 c6"><span class="c0">Sales and marketing can use the information to tailor special deals and incentives for the customer.</span></li><li class="c3 c6"><span class="c0">Airport staff can ensure that all high-paying customers have escorts to their connecting flights. At the very least they can facilitate communications to ensure that the passenger doesn&rsquo;t walk up to the gate just as the airplane is pulling away.</span></li><li class="c3 c6"><span class="c0">Flight staff can, as I mentioned, tailor the in-flight experience to fulfill the expectations of the customer.</span></li><li class="c1 c3"><span class="c0">Customer service call center attendants can keep track of calls or inquiries and ensure that any special requests before the flight are passed to the right area.</span></li></ul><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All around, Prof. McPherson&rsquo;s experience with your airline was poor. However, you did redeem yourself with the eventually satisfying flight to Frankfurt. This just goes to prove that customer service can, in theory, be improved with technology. (He did, after all, see the 7:55pm flight on a flat-panel television kiosk) However, in practice, British Airways hasn&rsquo;t yet harnessed the full potential of available software to solve the issue completely. This leaves customer service in the hands of human beings, and humans at the end of the day are far from infallible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sincerely,<br>Sam Dowd</span></p></body></html>
